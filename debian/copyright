 MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS
 .
 MICROSOFT C/C++ EXTENSION FOR VISUAL STUDIO CODE
 ________________________________________
 These license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or
 one of its affiliates). They apply to the software named above and any
 Microsoft services or software updates (except to the extent such services or
 updates are accompanied by new or additional terms, in which case those
 different terms apply prospectively and do not alter your or Microsoft’s
 rights relating to pre-updated software or services). IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE
 LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.  BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT
 THESE TERMS.
 .
 1.      INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.
 a)      General. You may install and use any number of copies of the software
 only with Microsoft Visual Studio, Visual Studio for Mac, Visual Studio Code,
 Azure DevOps, Team Foundation Server, and successor Microsoft products and
 services to develop and test your applications. Further, you may install, use
 and/or deploy these software copies via a network management system or as part
 of a desktop image within your internal corporate network to develop and test
 your applications.
 b)      Third Party Components. The software may include third party components
 with separate legal notices or governed by other agreements, as may be
 described in the ThirdPartyNotices file(s) accompanying the software.
 .
 2.      SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement
 only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other
 rights.  For clarification Microsoft, or its licensors, retains ownership of
 all aspects of the software.   Unless applicable law gives you more rights
 despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted
 in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations
 in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. For example, if
 Microsoft technically limits or disables extensibility for the software, you
 may not extend the software by, among other things, loading or injecting into
 the software any non-Microsoft add-ins, macros, or packages; modifying the
 software registry settings; or adding features or functionality equivalent to
 that found in Microsoft products and services. You may not:
 a)      work around any technical limitations in the software that only allow
 you to use it in certain ways;
 b)      reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise
 attempt to derive the source code for the software, except and to the extent
 required by third party licensing terms governing use of certain open source
 components that may be included in the software;
 c)      remove, minimize, block, or modify any notices of Microsoft or its
 suppliers in the software;
 d)      use the software in any way that is against the law or to create or
 propagate malware; or
 e)      share, publish, distribute, or lease the software (except for any
 distributable code, subject to the terms above), provide the software as a
 stand-alone offering for others to use, or transfer the software or this
 agreement to any third party.
 .
 3.      DATA.
 a)      Data Collection. The software may collect information about you and
 your use of the software, and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this
 information to provide services and improve our products and services. You may
 opt-out of many of these scenarios, but not all, as described in the product
 documentation.  There are also some features in the software that may enable
 you to collect data from users of your applications. If you use these features
 to enable data collection in your applications, you must comply with applicable
 law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications. You
 can learn more about data collection and use in the help documentation and the
 privacy statement at https://aka.ms/privacy. Your use of the software operates
 as your consent to these practices.
 b)      Processing of Personal Data. To the extent Microsoft is a processor or
 subprocessor of personal data in connection with the software, Microsoft makes
 the commitments in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation Terms
 of the Online Services Terms to all customers effective May 25, 2018, at
 https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/gdpr.
 .
 4.      EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and
 international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which
 include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further
 information on export restrictions, visit https://aka.ms/exporting.
 .
 5.      SUPPORT SERVICES. Microsoft is not obligated under this agreement to
 provide any support services for the software. Any support provided is “as
 is”, “with all faults”, and without warranty of any kind.
 .
 6.      ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and any other terms Microsoft may
 provide for supplements, updates, or third-party applications, is the entire
 agreement for the software.
 .
 7.      APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. If you acquired the
 software in the United States or Canada, the laws of the state or province
 where you live (or, if a business, where your principal place of business is
 located) govern the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach,
 and all other claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and
 tort claims), regardless of conflict of laws principles. If you acquired the
 software in any other country, its laws apply. If U.S. federal jurisdiction
 exists, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the
 federal court in King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court. If
 not, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the
 Superior Court of King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court.
 .
 8.      CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain
 legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the
 laws of your state or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with
 Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you
 acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the
 laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you
 acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law
 applies, then the following provisions apply to you:
 a)      Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer
 Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.
 b)      Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving
 updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device
 from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet, however, the
 software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the
 software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off
 updates for your specific device or software.
 c)      Germany and Austria.
 i.      Warranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially as
 described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. However,
 Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the licensed software.
 ii.     Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross
 negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of
 death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the
 statutory law.
 Subject to the foregoing clause ii., Microsoft will only be liable for slight
 negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations,
 the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the
 breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance
 with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations").
 In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight
 negligence.
 .
 9.      DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS IS.” YOU BEAR
 THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR
 CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES
 ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
 .
 10.     LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR
 RECOVERING DAMAGES DESPITE THE PRECEDING DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY, YOU CAN
 RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00.
 YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS,
 SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
 This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services,
 content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party
 applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, warranty, guarantee, or
 condition; strict liability, negligence, or other tort; or any other claim; in
 each case to the extent permitted by applicable law.
 It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the
 possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to
 you because your state, province, or country may not allow the exclusion or
 limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages.
 .
 Please note: As this software is distributed in Canada, some of the clauses in
 this agreement are provided below in French.
 .
 Remarque: Ce logiciel étant distribué au Canada, certaines des clauses dans
 ce contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en français.
 .
 EXONÉRATION DE GARANTIE. Le logiciel visé par une licence est offert « tel
 quel ». Toute utilisation de ce logiciel est à votre seule risque et péril.
 Microsoft n’accorde aucune autre garantie expresse. Vous pouvez bénéficier
 de droits additionnels en vertu du droit local sur la protection des
 consommateurs, que ce contrat ne peut modifier. La ou elles sont permises par
 le droit locale, les garanties implicites de qualité marchande,
 d’adéquation à un usage particulier et d’absence de contrefaçon sont
 exclues.
 .
 LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS ET EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR LES
 DOMMAGES. Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft et de ses fournisseurs une
 indemnisation en cas de dommages directs uniquement à hauteur de 5,00 $ US.
 Vous ne pouvez prétendre à aucune indemnisation pour les autres dommages, y
 compris les dommages spéciaux, indirects ou accessoires et pertes de
 bénéfices.
 .
 Cette limitation concerne:
 •       tout ce qui est relié au logiciel, aux services ou au contenu (y
 compris le code) figurant sur des sites Internet tiers ou dans des programmes
 tiers; et
 •       les réclamations au titre de violation de contrat ou de garantie, ou
 au titre de responsabilité stricte, de négligence ou d’une autre faute dans
 la limite autorisée par la loi en vigueur.
 .
 Elle s’applique également, même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait
 connaître l’éventualité d’un tel dommage. Si votre pays n’autorise pas
 l’exclusion ou la limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects,
 accessoires ou de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou
 l’exclusion ci-dessus ne s’appliquera pas à votre égard.
 .
 EFFET JURIDIQUE. Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques. Vous
 pourriez avoir d’autres droits prévus par les lois de votre pays. Le
 présent contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois de
 votre pays si celles-ci ne le permettent pas.
